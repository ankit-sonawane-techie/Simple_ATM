A **Java console-based ATM program** that allows users to **check balance**, **deposit money**, and **withdraw money** interactively.  
This project demonstrates the use of **object-oriented programming (OOP)** concepts such as **classes, objects, and methods**, as well as **loops and switch-case** for menu-driven operations.
